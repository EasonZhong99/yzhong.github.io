#linktitle: Introduction to DSGE models and Dynare
summary: This video course provides an introduction to a very simple DSGE model and its implementation in Dynare. Topics like deriving model equations, computing the steady-state, calibrating model parameters and doing both deterministic as well as stochastic simulations are covered. Tips and tricks for making use of Dynare's preprocessing capabilities, modularization of files and flipping of variables and parameters are presented.
