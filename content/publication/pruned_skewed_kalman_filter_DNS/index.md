abstract: "We propose a computationally efficient algorithm designed to address the *curse of increasing dimensions* found in the *Skewed Kalman Filter*.
The algorithm's accuracy and efficiency are substantiated through a comprehensive simulation study encompassing both univariate and multivariate state-space models.
We demonstrate applicability by estimating a multivariate dynamic Nelson-Siegel term structure model and a New Keynesian DSGE model on US data with Maximum Likelihood.
In both applications, the results reveal a strong preference for a skewed error term distribution."
