</br >Willi Mutschler serves as an Assistant Professor of International Macroeconomics at the [University of Tuebingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/11321), and actively contributes as a member of the [Dynare Team](https://www.dynare.org/about/#team), focusing on the development and maintenance of the identification and method-of-moments toolboxes.

His academic pursuits are centered around dissecting the underlying causes of business cycles, leveraging novel identification and estimation approaches tailored for dynamic and stochastic models (DSGE and SVAR) that incorporate skewed distributions and rare disasters. His more recent investigations shed light on the economic ramifications of major interstate conflicts and wars.

Open-source and open education are of significant value to him. Therefore, you are warmly invited to explore the [Dynare Teaching Materials](dynare), delve into recent courses on [Computational Macroeconomics](https://github.com/wmutschl/Computational-Macroeconomics) and [Quantitative Macroeconomics](https://github.com/wmutschl/Quantitative-Macroeconomics), and engage with [tutorials and lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/wmutschl) for a deeper understanding of these topics.

Feel free to *[contact](#contact)* me directly or to *[schedule an appointment](https://schedule.mutschler.eu)*.
