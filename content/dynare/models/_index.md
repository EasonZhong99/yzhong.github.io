## What you will learn
In this series of tutorials and videos, I will cover the theoretical foundations of modern DSGE models. I will focus on several popular DSGE models and discuss both the underlying economic theory but also the mathematical steps to get the model equations we need for Dynare. Finally, we'll make intensive use of Dynare's preprocessing capabilities when creating the corresponding mod files.
